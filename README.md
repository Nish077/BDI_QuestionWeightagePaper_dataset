# BDI_QuestionWeightagePaper_dataset
This dataset is designed for research into depression severity assessment, specifically using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)
 The dataset includes responses from approximately 1000-1500 individuals, with each participant completing the 21-item BDI questionnaire. Each BDI item measures specific symptoms associated with depression, such as sadness, pessimism, and social withdrawal.


 Objective:
The primary objective of this research is to apply machine learning techniques to analyze the weight or importance of each individual BDI question in relation to the overall depression severity score. This will help in identifying which symptoms have the highest impact on overall depression severity, potentially aiding in more targeted and effective assessment strategies.
